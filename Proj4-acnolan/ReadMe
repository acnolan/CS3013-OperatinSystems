Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project 4 is a program that searches files for specified substrings.
Running the program is done through the command line with:
'./proj4 filename searchstring [size|mmap|pn]' where filename is the
name of the file you want to search, searchstring is the substring 
you are searching for. The remaining argument is an optional choice
between size, an integer value for the chunk size you want to search with 
at in bytes with the read command. mmap is called with 'mmap' and searches
the file using a memory map. Finally pn searches through the file with
a memory map using n number of parallel threads. At most there can be
16 threads and the maximum chunk size is 8 bytes (8192 bytes). The default
search is using 1 KB chunks.
