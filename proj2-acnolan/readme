Project 2
==========================================================================
By: Andrew Nolan

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files Included
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
phase1 folder:
	Makefile - the makefile for phase1
	phase1_module.c - the interceptor for sys_open and sys_close, and the example on syscall1 
	phase1_test.c -the user land code to test phase 1
	syslog_phase1 - the syslog after running the phase1 code shows the open and closing of files
			as well as the hello world interception.

phase2 folder:
	Makefile - the makefile for phase2
	phase2_module.c - the code for the kernel interceptor of the cs3013_syscall2 function
	phase2_test.c - the user land test code to test the interceptor
	syslog_phase2 - the syslog after running the phase 2 code

Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my submission for project 2 of CS3013.
The project contains 2 phases, first an interception
of the sys_open and sys_close system commands. The
second phase involves intercepting the cs3013_syscall2
that was made in the preproject. The call now takes a
pointer to a struct as a parameter and returns statistics
about the process.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 1 Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
When in the phase 1 folder run the command make.
Next user the interceptor with the commmand "sudo insmod phase1_module.ko"
The system opens and closes many files very often so looking at the syslog,
located at /var/log/syslog will show you the interceptors effects. To see
the effects of the interception of cs3013_syscall1, it can be read by the 
command "cat /var/log/syslog | grep EXTERMINATE" or you can perform 
"cat syslog_phase1 | grep EXTERMINATE" to see an example from my test run.
I ran multiple tests, so the log file may include multiple occurences of
EXTERMINATE and loaded. There are no known errors in phase1. It is
recommended to remove this interceptor when you are done because it
causes large amounts of syslog clutter.

Phase 2 Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 2 allows you to recieve stats about the process that is 
running. When in the phase2 folder you can run the commmand "make".
This will create the files needed to run the program. First 
insert the phase2_module.ko  with "sudo insmod phase2_module.ko".
Next you can run your own tests or mine via "./phase2_test". There is
a known error for my implementation of phase2, that being the 
child times are often 0, however this could just be my test implementation.
I think the logic for adding child time is correct, if you as the grader 
see what could be wrong with it please let me know!
