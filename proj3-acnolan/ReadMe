Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project 3 is designed to show an introduction to coding
with multiple threads. Part 1 of the assignment is a 
basic message passing system that uses multiple threads
to do a summation from 1 to a user given number. It does
this by splitting the numbers that need to be added evenly
between the threads. The parent thread then adds them back
together. Part 2 builds upon the message passing system
made in part 1. Part 2 performs John Conway's Game of Life 
using multiple threads for increased performance on
multiprocessors. The checking of rows is split between the
threads. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to run part 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 1 of the assignment is called addem.
First run the make file by calling the command
make in the directory holding the code. Next 
run './addem threads countTo' where threads is 
the number of threads you want to be used, and 
countTo is the number you want the threads to count
to. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to run part 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
After using the make command. Run
'./life threads filename generations (print) (input)'
threads is the number of threads to use. filename is
the name of the file with the starting generation in
it. This must be made of 0s and 1s separated by a space.
Generations is the number of generations to simulate.
print is an optional parameter of 'y' that prints 
every generation instead of just the first and last ones.
input is also optional, enabling input with a 'y' 
requires you to press enter before it will display the
next generation. The input option will only work if
the print option is also enabled.
